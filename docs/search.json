Using data from over 46,000 MLB at-bats during the 2020 MLB season, we examined various predictors that could influence whether a home run was hit. During our preliminary exploration of the data, we tried different types of classification models, such as logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forests, and bootstrap aggregating (bagging) forests. Our analysis focused on creating a model that both interpretable and accurate. For our full analysis, please use the following link to download the report."

We were given a broad outline for this essay: any topic in the social, cultural, or political aspects of sports. As a passionate baseball fan, I wanted to do a study into how small-market MLB teams compare in performance to small-market teams in other major sports leagues. Small-market teams are the core of any league, and sports are better when small-market teams are successful. For my full research, please use the following link to download the case study."

I chose to do my study on car accident data from the Texas Department of Transportation in 2022. Although there is no analysis in this project, I thought it would be interesting to include one of the first data visualizations I ever made on my website.

    "text": "As a passionate sports fan, I am interested in using statistics to make an impact in the sports world. Whether it is in player development, player valuation, or team strategy, I hope to use my statistical knowledge and background to create an advantage for teams. I have already done several sports-related projects in my courses, and I plan to continue to do more in-depth studies as I deepen my statistics knowledge.\nI have been fortunate to have several leadership opportunities at Macalester. Going into my sophomore year, I was chosen to be a baseball representative for the Macalester Student Athlete Mentors (SAMs). In SAMs, we collaborate with faculty and varsity coaches to build a community among student-athletes and other students at Macalester, as well as connect student-athletes with on-campus mental health and student support services. Additionally, after my sophomore year, I was chosen to be a part of the Macalester Baseball leadership team. The leadership team works with the coaching staff and players to foster team performance and positive culture. I was also awarded with CSC Academic All-District Honors after the 2025 Spring season.\nIn addition to statistics and sports, I enjoy playing video games, working out, hunting, fishing, scuba diving, and spending time with my friends and family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my dog Piper while hunting in South Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe, my dad, and my brother scuba diving in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my friends at an Astros game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture I took of a sunrise in South Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
