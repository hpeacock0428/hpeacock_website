As a passionate sports fan, I am interested in using statistics to make an impact in the sports world. Whether it is in player development, player valuation, or team strategy, I hope to use my statistical knowledge and background to create an advantage for teams. I have already done several sports-related projects in my courses, and I plan to continue to do more in-depth studies as I deepen my statistics knowledge.

I have been fortunate to have several leadership opportunities at Macalester. Going into my sophomore year, I was chosen to be a baseball representative for the Macalester Student Athlete Mentors (SAMs). In SAMs, we collaborate with faculty and varsity coaches to build a community among student-athletes and other students at Macalester, as well as connect student-athletes with on-campus mental health and student support services. Additionally, after my sophomore year, I was chosen to be a part of the Macalester Baseball leadership team. The leadership team works with the coaching staff and players to foster team performance and positive culture. I was also awarded with CSC Academic All-District Honors after the 2025 Spring season.

In addition to statistics and sports, I enjoy playing video games, working out, hunting, fishing, scuba diving, and spending time with my friends and family.
