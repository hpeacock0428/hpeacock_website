I wrote this case study for my final research project in my Sports Geography course in Spring 2024. We were given a broad outline for this essay: any topic in the social, cultural, or political aspects of sports. As a passionate baseball fan, I wanted to do a study into how small-market MLB teams compare in performance to small-market teams in other major sports leagues. Small-market teams are the core of any league, and sports are better when small-market teams are successful.
