In this assignment, we completed several different types of classification to build a model that can predict whether a batted ball is a home run. Using data from over 46,000 MLB at-bats during the 2020 MLB season, we examined various predictors that could influence whether a home run was hit. During our preliminary exploration of the data, we tried different types of classification models, such as logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forests, and bootstrap aggregating (bagging) forests. Our analysis focused on creating a model that both interpretable and accurate.
