In this project, we conducted several linear regressions on the relationship between various pitch factors and the batter's resulting hard-hit rate. Our analysis focuses on pitch velocity, break, and spin rate, and the resulting hard-hit rate in an attempt to determine which pitch factor has the largest influence on lowering batter hard-hit rate. For the complete analysis, please use the following link to [download the report](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1FLU320rAKlrG34TtsuDksIM_P7GnbsAH).
